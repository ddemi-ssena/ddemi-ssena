### Computer Engineering Student | AI & Data-Oriented Software Developer

I am a final-year Computer Engineering student interested in building AI-powered
systems that go beyond model accuracy and focus on **supporting real-world
decision-making**, while continuously exploring different areas of software and
AI development.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **artificial intelligence, analytics, and
software engineering**, where data is transformed into insights that are
interpretable, actionable, and ethically grounded. Through my projects, I like
experimenting with different technologies, domains, and problem settings,.

### 🪷🎡🎬 Beyond Technology

Outside of technical work, I enjoy reading novels and psychology books, exploring
films and series, and learning about different cultures. These interests help me
develop a broader perspective, empathy, and a deeper understanding of human
behavior, which I believe is essential when building technology that interacts
with people and organizations.



🌌I am motivated by thoughtful problem-solving, continuous learning, and building
reliable systems that turn data and ideas into meaningful, responsible, and
scalable impact.
